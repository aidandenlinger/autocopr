inputs:
  mode:
    description: "The mode the action should run in. Options:
      - `push`: Automated updates. If any specfile is outdated, write new specfiles, make a commit for each with an associated tag, and push it to the repo. Requires `contents: write` permissions on the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow for pushes to a repo. See the `README.md` to learn how to start a COPR build based on these commits being pushed.

      - `check`: Manual updates. The job succeeds if all specfiles are up to date and fails if any are outdated. This mode does not write new files or push any updates - updating the specfile requires manual action. This mode is more secure since the action is read-only.

      - `dry-run`: Intended for testing. The job is read-only and always succeeds, no matter if the specfiles are up to date or not. Like all other modes, it logs to stdout which files are up to date or not.

      There are other modes you can use here (`update`), but they're only intended for local use. You can read about them in the README under the `mode` flag, and you're allowed to use them here. If you find a use for them in CI, raise an issue and I'll document them here!"
